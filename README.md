## To Run:
This project was trained and run in a pyhton virtual environment venv. To create your own, run 'python -m venv venv' in the project directory. After creating venv run 'source venv/bin/activate'. To run the code enter 'python Final_AI_proj.py' in the terminal. It may take a while to train because the number of episodes are set to 1500. The code that saves the results plot, and the training gif, has been commented out for submission. The code will not overwrite the submitted training gif and results plot, but it will still show you the results plot from your training run.
